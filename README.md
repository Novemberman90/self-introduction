Hello. My name is Alexey Ivashchenko and I am 32 years old. I'm from Ukraine. I have an engineering education in mechanical engineering. I work as a regional representative of an Italian company and manage a dealer network in my region. I started to get interested in web development in the summer of 2022 when we moved to another city due to the war. My wife is an interior designer and she said "My website looks bad on mobile. How can I fix this?" . And I decided to try, to do something. Because I had friends who did this and told me something. It didn't work out very well. And then she found web development courses at The Rolling Scopes School right at Stage 1. And here I am.
